## Juvenile Crime, Adult Time — Direct File in Florida

By: Shirsho Dasgupta (2023-2024)

The Miami Herald obtained data on all children recorded in Florida’s Department of Juvenile Justice databases from 2008 to 2022. The information included their demographic backgrounds, charges and the ultimate outcome of each case. The Herald converted this incident-level data into individual-type data. 

Reporters computed rates for state-wide figures as well as for every county and each of the 20 judicial circuits. The Herald also computed logistic regressions to report on racial disparities among who gets direct filed. All of the published figures that the Herald obtained via these regressions have p-values of less than 0.05, rendering them statistically significant. 

Reporters performed split sample analyses to verify consistency in results. To ensure that a single outlier judicial circuit was not influencing state-wide figures in a particular direction, the Herald also computed the state-wide regression twenty times, each time excluding one circuit. The results were roughly the same. 

Reporters consulted and shared their findings with Alexis Piquero, a criminologist and statistician with the University of Miami to verify its statistical methodology and regression models. Piquero has previously served as head of the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and is the author of over 500 scholarly articles. 

While computing the rates of kids direct filed by race for each county, reporters noticed that the figure for Hispanic kids was uncharacteristically low even in counties with high shares of Hispanic residents. Some defense attorneys also told the Herald that they have handled many cases where the demographic information of their clients, noted in arrest reports and intake forms, had been incorrect. 

The Herald created a list of common Hispanic last names — names that appear in 60% or more of Hispanic residents — from the U.S. Census Bureau’s database of name genealogies and matched them with the Corrections’ Department’s inmate database, flagging inmates who had one of those last names but were classified as “WHITE” instead of “HISPANIC.”

At least 40,000 potentially Hispanic inmates have been classified as white, per the Herald’s estimates since the 1950s. 

Erroneous demographic information at the initial stages of a person entering the criminal justice system filters down through subsequent agencies and makes it difficult to accurately audit for disparities at the level of a local police department, a county, a judicial circuit or even the whole state. 

It also means that the figures reported by the Herald in this series may be undercounts — disparities may be starker. 

Since Black and non-Hispanic white last names are often similar, the Herald was not able to perform the same analysis for Black inmates with lighter complexion potentially being also marked as white.

The Herald also obtained a copy of the Offender Based Transaction System (OBTS) maintained by Florida courts. The database contains records of every individual who has come into contact with the state’s legal system — from the point of arrest to their final sentence. Additional factors which can determine a sentence such as whether a weapon was used or the quantity of drugs trafficked or money stolen were not released to the Herald per Florida laws. Names and exact birth dates were also not released. Only the month and year of birth for each individual was made available to the Herald. 

To estimate the number of minors tried as adults, the Herald assumed that each person recorded in the database was born on the 15th of the month. The total number of minors obtained through this method was similar to the number of children tried in adult court that the Herald calculated from a separate dataset maintained by the Florida Juvenile Justice Department. Roughly 98% of those children, the Herald found, were transferred to the adult system via the state’s “direct file” statutes — a 30-year-old state law that gives prosecutors sole discretion to try children in adult criminal courts. To observe the frequency distributions of the sentences, the Herald checked central tendency measures like medians, modes and standard deviations. Capital felonies, life felonies and first-degree felonies punishable by life imprisonment make up a tiny fraction of all offenses and typically have extreme sentences, the Herald found. These offenses were excluded from the analysis of average sentences. 

To verify for consistency, the Herald adjusted for extreme sentences in the more common felonies so they don’t skew the figures while calculating the mean sentences of adults and minors tried as adults. The Herald first computed the 85th percentile — the figure below which 85% of the sentences fell — and then re-coded all the sentences above that value as that figure. For instance, if the 85th percentile was five years, then all of the sentences above five were re-coded to be five. The trend of children getting higher average sentences than adults held even after the adjustments.

Identifying and locating inmates was a challenge. 

The data released by Florida’s Juvenile Justice Department was anonymized due to privacy laws. Herald reporters connected with those who had been direct filed and their loved ones with the help of defense attorneys and prison inmate welfare groups. 

Reporters also separately identified inmates from the Corrections Department’s publicly available inmate database: The Herald subtracted the birthdate of each inmate from the day they entered the prison system to flag those who entered the facilities as juveniles. 

They spent hours speaking to inmates currently serving time in the state’s adult prisons after being direct filed, children and their loved ones who are presently going through the legal process and people who have now been released from prison after being direct filed as kids. The Herald also spoke to more than 50 public defenders, criminal defense lawyers and legal experts from across Florida. 

Reporters reviewed the complete case histories of all of the kids and now-released adults they spoke to: Hundreds of pages of court records, including sometimes handwritten pleas to judges, and hours of video footage obtained through more than 70 records requests filed with county court clerks, law enforcement agencies and school districts across Florida for this project. 

Differences in state laws and data collection practices mean it is not possible to make a fair quantitative comparison between Florida and other states ​​when it comes to measuring where Florida stands in the country in terms of how many kids it sends to the adult system through direct file or similar laws.

But the Herald did compile and perform a qualitative review of the laws different states have and gauged Florida’s standing nationally. The Herald consulted Hunter Hurst, director of the National Center for Juvenile Justice, a nonpartisan juvenile justice research group based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. NCJJ was founded in 1973 by the Honorable Maurice B. Cohill, Jr., a former federal judge in Pennsylvania's Western District.

The Herald reviewed state and applicable federal statutes and regulations collated by the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction to understand all of the consequences a Floridian deals with after release if they have a felony conviction. The NICCC was started by the American Bar Association in 2012 and is funded by the U.S. Justice Department. 

Other records the Herald used for this project include demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau and juvenile crime figures from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and U.S. Justice Department.
